        "ask": "How can we be saved?",
        "answer": "Only by faith in Jesus Christ and in his substitutionary atoning death on the cross; so even though we are guilty of having disobeyed God and are still inclined to all evil, nevertheless, God, without any merit of our own but only by pure grace, imputes to us the perfect righteousness of Christ when we repent and believe in him."

He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting."

        "ask": "Should those who have faith in Christ seek their salvation through their own works, or anywhere else?",

        "ask": "Since we are redeemed by grace alone, through Christ alone, must we still do good works and obey God’s Word?",
        "answer": "Yes, because Christ, having redeemed us by his blood, also renews us by his Spirit; so that our lives may show love and gratitude to God; so that we may be assured of our faith by the fruits; and so that by our godly behavior others may be won to Christ."
    }},
    { "question": {
        "number": 35,
        "ask": "Since we are redeemed by grace alone, through faith alone, where does this faith come from?",

        "ask": "What is the Lord’s Supper?",
        "answer": "Christ commanded all Christians to eat bread and to drink from the cup in thankful remembrance of him and his death. The Lord’s Supper is a celebration of the presence of God in our midst; bringing us into communion with God and with one another; feeding and nourishing our souls.

        "number": 47,
        "ask": "Does the Lord’s Supper add anything to Christ’s atoning work?",
        "answer": "No, Christ died once for all. The Lord’s Supper is a covenant meal celebrating Christ’s atoning work; as it is also a means of strengthening our faith as we look to him, and a foretaste of the future feast. But those who take part with unrepentant hearts eat and drink judgment on themselves."
